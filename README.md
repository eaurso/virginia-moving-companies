# README

This is my third and best attempt at creating a rails project and it was so much easier this time around. I am helping a [local Virginia moving company](https://www.ablemoving.com) and I'm confident that I can utilize Ruby on Rails to help this fantastic company.

My experience with rails is nothing compared to my experience with helping local business owners improve their web presence. By learning new methods to help my customers, I stay on top of my competition and this is no exception. I also seem to know everyone who has a moving truck in Virginia. That includes movers in the surrounding areas of Arlington, Alexandria, and Fairfax.

However, I must admit I typically like building websites in either Weebly or Wordpress, but I saw the value that Ruby on Rails had to offer. So here I am giving this site another chance. I'm mainly looking for increased credibility and visibility benefits and I think this will be an excellent test to find out just how effective it can be. I've been doing cleint work for a long time and have ranked some incredible websites in areas I thought was near impossible. However, ranking for moving companies northern va has proved to be the hardest of them all.
